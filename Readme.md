This is a very basic group chat application which can be run on any platform except
ios.

APK file (file for android) is in apk folder, and files for other platforms are in 
python_source_code folder.

Which ever the platform it is, you have to run the server program in a python installed
system. Then only chat application works well.

How to run the application:
  1. Run the server program in a computer.(Python should be installed)
  2. Run the application.
  3. Type your name in the Username input box.
  4. Type private ip address of the server system including port number(2022) in 
      given format -" ip_address:2022 "
  5. Press the login button.

Please Note:
  Both the server and the clients should be in same network.

Kindly inform me if there is any problem.
